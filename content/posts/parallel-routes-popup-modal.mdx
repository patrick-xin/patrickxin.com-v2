## Introduction

In modern web development, understanding routes is crucial. It ensures seamless user navigation. While basic routing is straightforward, parallel and intercepting routes can be challenging. In this guide, we'll learn these concepts by building a popup modal.

## Parallel vs. Intercepting Routes

- **Parallel Routes**: These are routes that can co-exist, allowing multiple views or components to be visible simultaneously.
- **Intercepting Routes**: These routes intercept a user's intended navigation, often used for confirmations or showing modals.

## Building a Popup Modal: A Practical Approach

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
Begin with a basic web project setup. Choose a framework you're comfortable with.

### Step 2: Defining Routes
Before diving into parallel and intercepting routes, define some basic routes for your application.

### Step 3: Implementing Parallel Routes
Here, we'll design a side panel or a floating component that co-exists with the main content.

### Step 4: Creating the Modal
Design a basic modal that will act as our intercepting route.

### Step 5: Implementing Intercepting Routes
Whenever a user performs a specific action, the modal will pop up, intercepting their intended navigation.

## Conclusion

By building a popup modal, we've practically explored the concepts of parallel and intercepting routes. These techniques are fundamental in creating intuitive and interactive web applications.
